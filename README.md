This repository includes the source code of "**Enhancing Link Prediction in Graph Neural Networks through Diffusion-Based Multivariate Latent Variable Models**"

# Requirements

* Pytorch 
* python 3.x
* networkx
* scikit-learn
* scipy

# How to run
* Specify your arguments in `args.py` : you can change dataset and other arguments there
* run `python train.py`

# Notes

* Dropout is not implemented now.
* Feel free to report some inefficiencies in the code! (It's just initial version)
